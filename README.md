Projects written by me in JavaScript programming language.

# What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a popular scripting language used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages. It is a client-side language, meaning that it runs in a user's web browser rather than on a server. JavaScript is an important part of web development, as it allows web pages to be more dynamic and interactive, improving the user experience.

JavaScript is often used to add functionality to web pages, such as form validation, animations, and dynamic content. It can also be used to interact with APIs and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), which is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.

JavaScript is an open-source language, which means it is free to use and can be modified and distributed by anyone. It is supported by all modern web browsers and is a key component of many popular web frameworks and libraries, including AngularJS, React, and Vue.js.
